# Molecular Function Refactoring

STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL/DRAFT   

An repository for discussion & development of
* Proposed high-level / intermediate MF classes that group by biological context
  * These terms will need logical definitions.  Code on this site will test the usefulness of these defs, which in turn will depend on improvments to MF axiomatisation.
* Patterns for defining compound MF terms
* Strategies and patterns for improving axiomatisation of simple MFs such as enzyme activities using Rhea & its mappings to ChEBI.
