# Receptor activity notes

A basic, uncontroversial taxonomy of [receptor types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)#Structure)

transmembrane receptor: transduces a signal across a membrane.
  - iontropic receptor: A sensor on one side of the membrane (typically ligand binding) opens or closes an ion channel. 
  - [enzyme linked transmembrane receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme-linked_receptor):  A sensor on one side of a membrane (typically ligand binding) activates an enzyme activity on the other (protein kinase or guanylate cyclase activity)
  - G-protein coupled receptor: A sensor on one side of the membrane (ligand binding or light) activates G-protein specific GEF activity on the other side of the membrane.
[nuclear receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor): Binding of ligand activates transcription factor acivity (typically by activating DNA binding activity, although in some cases there is also an effect on the ability to bind other parts of the transcriptional machinery.)

Note that (perhaps with the exception of nuclear receptor, these classes are defined without reference to larger processes.

The *term* receptor is also used for 'cargo receptors'.  These bind and target particular molecules as part of vesicular transport. They do not transduce a signal and should probably be treated as a seaprate, unrelated heirarchy in the GO.

Is it possible to unify the two transducing receptors classes described above using a necessary and sufficient (logical definition)?  This is surprisingly hard.  It is tempting to try to define them with reference to cell-cell signaling. This distingishes the classical nuclear receptors such as that for retinoic acid or for estrogen, from non-membrane transducers activated by intracellular ligands such as PKA (activated by cAMP) and Calmodulin (activated by Ca2+).  But some iontropic receptors use intracellular ligands, (e.g. IP3 receptors and ryanodine receptors on the ER), and some nuclear receptors may also [respond to intracellular signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor#Ligands). In the absence of clear necessary and sufficient criteria for defining a transducing receptor, we should probably just assert it as a superclassification for 'transmembrane receptor' and 'nuclear receptor' and use this as the genus class for defining all subclasses.

Unifying transmembrane receptors with some necessary and sufficient definition is more straightforward.  But what relation should we use to link receptor to membrane? **'occurs in'** is insufficient: Ligand binding doesn't (typically) occur in the membrane and arguably neither do enzyme effector functions or GEF activity.  To indicate cargo for transmembrane transporters and channels we use a specialized relation: **results_in_transport_across**.  By analogy we could define **results in  transduction across** or **results in regulation across**.  This same relation could be used to link receptors to specific membrane types in LEGO models.

What about classifications of receptors that take into account process context?
